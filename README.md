# Gitea

## What is Gitea?

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most
painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.
Using Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across
**all platforms** which Go supports, including Linux, macOS, and Windows
on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.
